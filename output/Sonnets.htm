          We want the most beautiful people to have children, so their beauty
          will be preserved forever—when the parent dies, the child he leaves
          behind will remind us of his beauty. But you, in love with your own
          pretty eyes, are letting your beauty burn itself out. You’re starving
          the world of your beauty rather than spreading the wealth around.
          You’re acting like your own worst enemy! Right now you’re the
          best-looking thing in the world, the only person as beautiful as
          springtime. But your beauty is like a new bud, and you’re letting it
          die before it can develop and bring you true happiness. You’re a young
          man, but you act like an old miser—you’re wasting your beauty by
          hoarding it and keeping it to yourself! Take pity on the rest of us,
          or this is how you’ll be remembered: as the greedy pig who hogged his
          own beauty and took it with him to the grave.

          beauty and youth raising a child. If someone were to ask you why you
          looked so old, you could say, “The effort I spent raising this

          <i>(Continuing from Sonnet 5)</i> So don’t let wintry old age destroy
          your summer beauty before your essence has been preserved. Make some
          woman pregnant and pass on your beauty before it dies with you. It’s
          unfair to charge exorbitant interest on a loan. But if you lend a
          woman your body, she’ll be only too happy to pay you back with a
          child. Having a child—making another version of yourself—will make you
          happy. Having ten children will make you ten times as happy. What
          power would death have over you if you left children behind to keep
          your legacy alive? Don’t be willful and selfish—you’re much too
          beautiful to be conquered by death, with nothing left of you but a

          You’re like music to listen to, so why does listening to music make
          you sad? Delightful and joyful things should complement one another.
          So why do you love things that make you unhappy and enjoy things that
          are bad for you? If music played well and in tune sounds bad to you,
          it’s because that music is rebuking you for not playing your own
          part—not making your own harmony—by getting married and having
          children. Notice how the sound of two strings vibrating together in
          harmony is like a father and child and happy mother, who all sing one
          pleasing note together. Though their music has no words, the unity of
          their voices sings this warning to you: If you stay single, you’ll be
          a childless nobody.

          only last as long as you’re alive. You should make preparations in
          anticipation of your inevitable death and pass on your beautiful
          appearance to someone else. That way, your beauty, which you’ve only
          borrowed, wouldn’t have to end. Then, even after you died, your

          I don’t base my judgments on the stars, and yet it does seem to me I
          know astrology. I can’t foresee good or bad events—predict plagues,
          famines, or what a season will be like. Nor can I predict down to the
          minute what each person’s misfortunes are going to be. Nor can I tell
          princes whether things will go well for them by looking at the
          heavens. But I can forecast the future by looking in your eyes. I see

          makeup—you, the man (or should I say<i> woman</i>?) I love. Your heart

          you look at. You’ve got the good looks of a handsome man, but you
          attract both women<i> and</i> men. When Mother Nature made you, she

          I’m not like that other poet who writes about a woman who’s pretty
          because she wears a lot of makeup. In his verses, he compares her to

          the rich gems of earth and sea, the first flowers of April, and all
          the rest of the precious things on the face of the earth. Since I

          do, believe me—my lover is as beautiful as any human being, though
          maybe not as bright as the stars. Whoever actually likes those

          Your own eyes are the windows into my heart. Now look at the favors
          our eyes have done for each other: My eyes have drawn your shape, and
          your eyes are windows into which I can look to see my own heart, into
          which the sun also likes to look, taking a peep at your reflection.

          Let fortunate people boast about their prizes and their titles, while
          I—who am not lucky enough to get such rewards—experience unexpected
          joy in what I honor most: your love. Those courtiers who enjoy high
          status because they’re the favorites of great princes are like
          marigolds. They bloom as long as the sun shines on them, but their
          pride is fragile—one frown will kill them. And once a famous warrior
          who has painfully endured and won a thousand battles is defeated, he’s
          stripped of all his honors, and all of the successes that he worked
          for are forgotten. How much happier am I, who love and am loved in a
          place I cannot leave and from which others cannot remove me.

          <i>(Continuing from Sonnet 27)</i> So how can I return in a cheerful
          state of mind when I’m prevented from getting any rest? When the
          oppression I experience during the day isn’t relieved by any sleep at
          night, but instead my sleepless nights oppress me during the day and
          my wearisome days oppress me at night? And though day and night are
          natural enemies, they’ve shook hands and made a bargain to both
          torture me, the day with labor, the night with thoughts of how far
          away you are as I labor over thoughts of you. I try to please the day
          by telling him how bright you are—so bright that you take the sun’s
          place when clouds cover the sky. In the same way, I use you to flatter
          black night, telling him how you brighten the evening sky when stars
          don’t shine. But they both—day and night—only prolong my sorrows, and
          night by night this prolonged grief grows stronger.

          love have I shed at funerals, in payment to the dead, when now it
          appears they had only gone to hide in your heart. You’re like a grave
          where dead lovers come alive again, decorated with mementos of those
          lost loves who gave you all the love I owed to each of them. All the
          love I owed to many is now yours alone. I see these lovers in you, and
          you, who contain everyone I have ever loved or was loved by, have all
          of me.

          But my eye, the defendant, denies the charges and argues that your
          beauty resides in him. To decide whose claim is right, I have
          assembled a jury consisting of my thoughts, all of which owe
          allegiance to the heart. And they have delivered a verdict to
          determine which portion of your image belongs to the eyes and which
          precious portion to the heart. This is what they say: My eyes have the
          rights to your outward appearance, and my heart has the right to love
          you and be loved by you.

          In anticipation of the time, if it ever comes, when I will see you
          frown at my defects; when mature reflection tells you that you’ve come

          will pass by me like a stranger, barely even acknowledging me with a
          glance of your brilliant eye; when your love for me isn’t love anymore
          and you’re guided only by somber judgment—in anticipation of that
          time, I’m establishing myself here, knowing how little I really
          deserve, and I’m giving testimony against myself to defend the justice
          of your future actions. You have every right to leave poor me—all the
          laws of reason back you up—since I can’t offer any justification for
          your loving me.

          Beauty seems so much more beautiful when it comes with honesty and
          integrity. Roses are beautiful, but we think they’re even more so
          because of their sweet scent. Wildflowers have as deep a color as
          fragrant roses; their thorns are the same, and their beauty broadcasts
          just as loudly when summer opens their buds. But because their only
          virtue is their looks, no one wants or respects them and they die
          unnoticed and alone. Sweet roses don’t suffer that fate. When they
          die, the most fragrant perfumes are made from their corpses. The same
          is true of you, beautiful youth. When you fade away, my poems will
          preserve your essence.

          about you? Do you want my sleep to be interrupted while I’m tantalized
          by mental images of you? Are you sending your spirit far from its home
          to pry into my dealings, to find out the shameful things I’ve been up
          to in idle hours? Are you jealous? Oh, no: Though you love me a great
          deal, you don’t love me that much. It’s <i>my</i> love for
          <i>you</i> that’s keeping me awake. My own true love keeps me from
          sleeping—staying up worrying about you. I stay up for you, while you
          are awake somewhere else: far away from me, but all too close to
          certain other people.

          and every part of me. There’s no way to get rid of this sin, it’s so

          high worth. I calculate my value such that I surpass everybody else in
          everything. But when my mirror shows me how I really look, beaten and
          cracked by age and the sun, I come to an opposite conclusion: For
          myself to love myself so much would be a sinful error. It’s you I’m
          praising when I praise myself, ornamenting my old age with the beauty
          of your youth.

          <i>(Continuing from Sonnet 67)</i> So his face is the incarnation of
          how things were in the old days, when beautiful people lived and died
          as commonly as flowers—before these illegitimate signs of beauty were
          created, or anyone dared to put them on a living human being. That was
          before the golden locks of corpses, which belong in graves, were cut
          off and made to live a second life on a second person’s head. It was
          before the hair of a beautiful corpse served to make another person
          happy. You can see the old-fashioned youthful beauty of his face: no
          wig to ornament it, the real thing in all its honesty, not borrowing
          someone else’s youth nor stealing from the old to look new again.
          Nature preserves him as a map, to show cosmetics what beauty used to
          be.

          Those parts of you that are visible to the world lack nothing, and no
          one could imagine improving them. Everybody admits this unreservedly,
          though they’re only saying what’s obviously true—what even your
          enemies praise you for. Thus, your outside is rewarded with public
          praise. But the same people who give you the praise your beauty
          deserves take quite another tack once they’ve looked beyond the
          surface. These people examine the beauty of your mind and character,
          and they guess at what’s in there by observing your actions. Then,
          though they judged your appearance kindly, their harsh thoughts tell
          them that although you appear beautiful you smell corrupt. So, if you
          don’t smell as good as you look, this is the reason: You’re hanging
          out with lowlifes.

          The fact that people say bad things about you won’t be held against
          you, because beautiful people have always been the target of slander.
          Beautiful people are always the objects of suspicion, a black crow
          darkening heaven. As long as you’re good, you’re a target of
          temptation; slander just proves how worthy you are. For vice, like a
          worm, loves to devour the sweetest buds the most, which makes you—in
          your prime, pure and unstained—a perfect target. You’ve escaped the
          traps that usually endanger young men, because either no one tempted
          you or you resisted the temptation. However, this praise I’ve given
          you won’t inflate your reputation so much that it keeps envious people
          from talking, because they always will. If your beauty weren’t masked
          by at least some suspicion of evil, you’d be the most beloved person
          in the world.

          <i>(Continuing from Sonnet 73)</i> But don’t be upset when death
          arrives to carry me off where no one can release me. My life will
          continue to some extent in these lines, which you’ll always have to
          remember me by. When you reread this, you’ll be seeing again the
          precise part of me that was dedicated to you. The earth can only have
          the earthly part of me, which is what belongs to it. My spirit, the
          better part of me, is yours. So when I’m dead you’ll have only my
          body—the dregs of my life, the part that worms eat, the only part of
          me that cowardly, wretched death could kill, the part that’s too
          worthless for you to remember. What gives my body its worth is the
          spirit it contains, and that spirit is this poem, and this poem will
          remain with you.

          and always in the same distinctive style, so that almost every word I

          you and love are continually my subjects. So the best I can do is find
          new words to say the same thing, spending again what I’ve already

          making me tell what I’ve already told.

          you’re beautiful, but he only found out about beauty from your face.

          I get very discouraged when I write about you, knowing that a superior
          writer is writing about you too. He uses all of his powers of praise
          to make me tongue-tied when I write about your glory. But since your
          worth is as big as the ocean, able to support the smallest boat as
          well as the biggest ship, my impudent little boat, which is far
          inferior to his, stubbornly makes an appearance on your waters. Even
          at your shallowest, you keep me afloat, while he sails out over your
          measureless depths. And if I wind up being wrecked, I’m only a
          worthless little vessel, whereas he’s a tall ship—something to be
          proud of. So if he does well and I find myself shipwrecked and
          discarded, the worst I can say is this: I was destroyed because of my
          love for you.

          silenced me with amazement. Neither he nor that friendly little ghost

          Goodbye; you’re too valuable for me to hold onto, and you probably
          know exactly what you’re worth. Your high value gives you the right to
          leave me; you have severed the ties that bind me to you. For what hold
          do I have over you except the hold that you choose to give me, and how
          do I deserve such a treasure? There’s nothing in me to justify such a
          beautiful gift, so my right to possess you is reverting back to you.
          When you gave yourself to me, you didn’t know your own worth, or else
          you were mistaken about me, the person you gave yourself to. So the
          great gift you gave me, being based on a false estimate, goes back to
          you now that you’re able to make a better judgment. Thus, the time in
          which I had you was like a flattering dream; while I was asleep, I
          thought I was a king, but when I woke up, I found that was not the
          case.

          I was away from you during the spring, when splendid April in all its
          finery made everything feel so young that even Saturn, the god of old
          age and gloominess, laughed and leaped along with it. But neither the
          songs of birds nor the sweet smell of all the various flowers could
          make me feel like it was summer or inspire me to go flower picking. I
          wasn’t amazed by how white the lily was, nor did I praise the deep red
          of the roses. They were only sweet, only pictures of delight, drawn in
          imitation of you, the archetype of spring. It seemed like it was still
          winter and, with you away, I played with these flowers as if I were
          playing with your reflection.

          <i>(Continuing from Sonnet 98)</i> This is how I scolded the
          presumptuous violet: “Sweet thief, where did you steal your sweet
          smell from if not from my beloved’s breath? You obviously got that
          purple color you’re so proud of by dying yourself in his blood.” I
          condemned the lily for stealing its whiteness from your hand and the
          marjoram buds for stealing your curly hair. The roses stood by
          anxiously, the red one blushing in shame, the white one pale with
          despair, knowing they were guilty of stealing your colors too. A third
          rose, neither red nor white, had stolen both red and white from your
          complexion, and added to his robbery the smell of your breath. But as
          punishment for his theft, a vengeful worm destroyed the rose just at
          its proudest growth. I noticed other flowers, and I couldn’t see any
          that hadn’t stolen its sweetness or color from you.

          You depend on, and are dignified by, him too. Answer me, Muse; perhaps
          you’ll say, “Truth doesn’t need to be embellished when it’s already
          attached to beauty. Beauty doesn’t need to be poetically described in
          order for its truth to be apparent. Whatever is best is best when it’s
          not mixed with anything else.” But just because my beloved needs no
          praise, will you be silent? You can’t excuse this silence, as you have
          the ability to make him live longer than a golden tomb and win the
          praise of future ages. Then do your job, Muse. I’ll teach you how to
          make him look in the distant future like he does now.

          richly he esteems the person he loves, he turns his love into a
          commodity. Our love was still new when I used to write poems about it,
          just as the nightingale sings at the beginning of summer, then stops
          singing as the summer progresses. It’s not that summer is less
          pleasant now than the nights when the nightingale sang. It’s just that
          every tree branch is filled with songbirds, and when things are common
          they’re less delightful. Therefore, like the nightingale, sometimes I
          keep silent because I don’t want to bore you with my song.

          in your freshness—and you’re still fresh and green. Ah, but beauty,
          like the hand of a clock, creeps away from the person it’s attached to
          so slowly no one can see it. In the same way, your sweet beauty, which
          seems to be standing still, is actually changing, and my eye may be
          deceived. In case it is, hear this, future generations: Before you
          were born, the greatest example of beauty was already dead.

          confined to a subject that’s always the same, it always expresses the
          same thing, never including anything different. The subject of my
          poems is the beautiful, kind, and faithful. I write about the
          beautiful, kind, and faithful in various ways, and this is the task
          that I expend all of my creativity on—three themes rolled up in one
          person, which offers an amazing scope for poetic invention. Beauty,
          kindness, and fidelity have often been divided into different people,
          but the three of them were never together in one person until now.

                alludes to Queen Elizabeth’s death (represented by the moon’s
                eclipse, described in line 5) and the subsequent release from

                be the young man of the sonnets. However, even in Shakespeare’s

          fortune-tellers now laugh at their own predictions. Things that once
          seemed doubtful have become certainties, and peace has come to stay.
          Now, with the blessings of these times, my beloved looks fresh again

          be your monument when tyrants reach the end of their reigns and tombs
          of brass fall into decay.

          Alas, it’s true, I have gone here and there, and made myself look
          foolish, and allowed my thoughts to be divided, and acted as if the

          the old infidelities I’ve committed before. It’s very true that I’ve
          treated true love strangely and with disdain. But I swear by heaven,
          these moments when I’ve swerved aside have made my heart young again,

          love, which will have no end. I will no longer whet my appetite for
          new lovers, causing suffering to my old friend, the god of love to

          promises and change even the decrees of kings—might darken a lover’s
          sacred beauty, take the edge off of a lover’s keenest intentions, and
          force the strongest minds to adapt to changing circumstances. Alas,

          I hope I may never acknowledge any reason why minds that truly love
          each other shouldn’t be joined together. Love isn’t really love if it
          changes when it sees the beloved change or if it disappears when the
          beloved leaves. Oh no, love is a constant and unchanging light that
          shines on storms without being shaken; it is the star that guides
          every wandering boat. And like a star, its value is beyond measure,
          though its height can be measured. Love is not under time’s power,
          though time has the power to destroy rosy lips and cheeks. Love does
          not alter with the passage of brief hours and weeks, but lasts until
          Doomsday. If I’m wrong about this and can be proven wrong, I never
          wrote, and no man ever loved.

          relationship strategy, which I adopted in anticipation of problems
          that didn’t exist, I actually became used to cheating on you. I
          applied medicine to a relationship that was healthy to begin with,
          attempting to cure something totally good by applying evil to it. But
          I learned from this—and I think what I learned is true—that the drugs
          I used are poisonous to me, since I’m so lovesick over you.

          even better through evil, and that when you ruin love and then rebuild
          it, it grows more beautiful than it was at first, as well as stronger
          and greater. So, having been rebuked for my mistake, I return to the
          person who makes me happy, and because of my evil deeds I get back
          three times what I spent.

          In the olden days, dark complexions weren’t considered attractive or,
          if they were, no one called them beautiful. But now darkness is
          officially accepted as beautiful, and the fair complexions that used
          to be called beautiful have gotten a bad reputation. For since
          everyone has seized the power to make themselves beautiful (which used
          to belong to nature), and ugly people can be beautiful by artificial
          means, no one can legitimately be called beautiful. Beauty has no
          special home but is commonplace or even lives in disgrace. Therefore
          my mistress’s eyes are as black as a raven, well suited to today’s
          fashion, and in their blackness they seem to be lamenting those people
          who were born ugly but make themselves beautiful, giving beauty a bad
          name by faking it. But her black eyes lament so beautifully that
          everyone now says all beautiful eyes should look like hers.

          Sex is a way of squandering vital energy while incurring shame. In
          anticipation of sex, lust makes people murderous, violent,
          blameworthy, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, and untrustworthy. No
          sooner do people enjoy sex than they immediately despise it. They go
          to absurd lengths in its pursuit only to hate it out of all proportion
          once they’ve had it, insisting it was put in their path on purpose to
          make them crazy. They’re extreme when they’re pursuing sex, extreme
          when they’re having it, and extreme once they’ve had it. It’s blissful
          while you’re doing it and, once you’re done, a true sorrow. While
          you’re anticipating it, it seems like a joy; afterward, like a bad
          dream. The world knows all this very well, yet no one knows enough to

          Curse you for making me suffer by hurting both my friend and me. Isn’t
          it enough to torture me alone without making my friend your slave too?
          Because of your cruel attractions I’m no longer my own man, but my
          friend, who’s like my second self, you’ve enslaved even more cruelly.
          So I’ve been abandoned by him, by myself, and by you; being frustrated
          like this is a triple torment multiplied by three. Go ahead and keep
          me as your prisoner, but then let me use myself to bail out my friend.
          Whoever you assign to watch me while I’m in this jail, let me be in
          charge of guarding my friend—then you can’t torment me in my prison
          because I’ll have my friend to keep me happy. And yet you
          <i>will</i> torment me, because I belong to you, so everything that’s
          in me is yours, and since my friend is in my heart, he’s yours too.

          adding another willing penis to the Will you already have. Since your
          sexual desires (and vagina) are both so enormous, won’t you agree just
          once to let me put my desire inside yours? Are you going to be
          attracted to everyone else’s will (penis), but reject mine? The sea is
          entirely made of water, but it still accepts additional water whenever
          it rains. So you, who already have a William, should in addition to
          your lover William accept my will (penis), making your sexual appetite
          (or vagina), which is already huge, even huger. Don’t kill an eager
          seducer by being unkind to him. Treat all your lovers as a single
          lover, and accept me (and my part) as part of that lover.

          herself breathed forth the words, “I hate”—and she was talking to me,
          the man who’s pining with love for her. But when she saw how unhappy
          she’d made me, mercy came into her heart and she chided her sweet
          tongue, which is usually so gentle and merciful, and taught it to
          speak something else to me. She changed “I hate” by adding a few words
          the way day follows night, that fiend flying from heaven to hell: She
          took hatred away from “I hate,” saving my life with “not you.”

          know that love is what gives you a conscience? In that case, gentle

          betray me, I betray my soul to my dumb, rebellious body. My soul tells
          my body that it can have its way in love. My flesh doesn’t wait to
          hear any more, but at the sound of your name it rises up and points
