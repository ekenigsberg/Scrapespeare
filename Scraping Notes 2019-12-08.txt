notes on scraping:

1) scraping as bytes, instead of as string, saves the trouble of having to look for individual problematic characters
    need to open text file using bytes, ie, open(strFile, 'ab')
    need to use .encode(encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') to write lines

2) look out for wide tooltips, marked by the tags <span class="noFear__tooltip__popup"><h4 class="noFear__tooltip__popup__heading">

3) couldn't get weasyprint to print landscape pdf
